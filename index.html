        <h1 id="introduction">Introduction to High Frequency Orderflow Trading</h1>
        <p>Financial markets have undergone tremendous growth and dramatic changes in thepast two decades, with the volume of daily trading in currency markets hitting over a trillion US dollars and hundreds of billions of dollars in bond and stock markets.Deregulation and globalization have led to large-scale capital flows; this has raisednew problems for finance as well as has further spurred competition among banksand financial institutions.The  resulting  booms,  bubbles  and  busts  of  the  global  financial  markets  nowdirectly affect the lives of hundreds of millions of people, as was witnessed duringthe 1998 East Asian financial crisis.The principles of banking and finance are fairly well established and the challenge is to apply these principles in an increasingly complicated environ-ment. The immense growth of financial markets, the existence of vast quantities offinancial data and the growing complexity of the market, both in volume and so-phistication, has made the use of powerful mathematical and computational toolsin finance a necessity. In order to meet the needs of customers, complex financial instruments have been created; these instruments demand advanced valuation and risk assessment models and systems that quantify the returns and risks for investorsand financial institutions .</p>
